How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Potential errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Allows you to quickly revert to prior versions to fix code bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Gives you more control as to when to commit chunks of code changes that make sense to you, but you might forget to make periodic commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is a specific version control software.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log shows all of the versions of the repository; diff allows one to compare the versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always rollback changes if need be.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Managing versioning for projects
